 * \brief Deinitializes rules for translating macros into class definitions.
 *
 * In Action Replay project, class declarations are made using special
 * macro definitions. Those definitions can be redefined, allowing to
 * use the same data for different roles. This allows the same set of
 * *.interface and *.class files to be used for declaring classes and
 * for setting up reflection. This creates a single point which has to
 * be changed if class declaration changes. This file must be used along
 * with <action_replay/class_begin.rules>. This file ends class translation
 * block. It is an error to include this file without starting the previous
 * block with <action_replay/class_begin.rules> (there are mechanisms that
 * will stop compilation if such event is detected). Example use:
 * #include <action_replay/class_begin.rules>
 * ACTION_REPLAY_CLASS_DECLARATION( foo );
 * ACTION_REPLAY_CLASS_DEFINITION( foo )
 * {
 *     ACTION_REPLAY_CLASS_FIELD( foo, int, bar )
 * }
 * #include <action_replay/class_end.rules>
